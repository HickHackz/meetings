# FOLDER HIERARCHY
# YOU MUST CREATE THESE FOLDERS BEFORE YOU RUN MUTT, YO
# the root of your emails will be the folder ~/Mail
# then subfolders ~/Mail/personal and ~/Mail/school
# then each of those should have an INBOX/ Sent\ Mail/ and Drafts/ folder
# and each of those should have a cur/ tmp/ and new/ folder
# and that is the general structure of an imap folder. 
# If you use the offlineimaprc file given, it should theoretically play nice
#
