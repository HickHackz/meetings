Privacy in communications is a fundamental human right codified in
Article 12 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Organizations
and individuals that participate in the mass surveillance of internet
communications are committing crimes against humanity.

In order to resist those that seek to abuse the powers of technology, as
well as to explicitly establish an objective expectation of privacy, I
strongly recommend the use of PGP encryption in all private dialogue
between individuals, yourself and myself included. My public key
fingerprint is published in the X-PGP-KEY header of this email, and is
searchable at pgp.mit.edu.
