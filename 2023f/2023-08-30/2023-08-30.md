Nathan's sharing about server project:
- Updates:
    - ACM's understanding is that the servers will be used as a general computer cluster for ACM and other SIGs
    - E.g. SIGAIDA, SIDPwny, have specific uses for local compute reseources
    - Looking for someone to co-lead, interfacing with ACM infra
    - theta: 2 servers up in the racks, 1 in the room. Is it possible to keep one for our use, Matrix, mirrors etc.
- Beowulf
    - How to put together a simple computing cluster
    - https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/Beowulf/beowulf_book/beowulf_book/beowulf_book.html
- Discussion
    - The 3 servers don't have to be a cluster. Could be individual servers.
    - VMs vs containers
    - Kubernetes
    - Daniel: There are other orgs / RSOs that want to setup dynamic sites.
    - theta: Would not prefer cluster, since we only have 3 machines. Maybe can consider that if we have more nodes.
