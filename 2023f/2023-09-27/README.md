# eBPF

Slides are eBPF.pdf. Demo was of bpftrace, which is hosted at [https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace). Stuck to one-liners. The [manual](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/man/adoc/bpftrace.adoc) was used in the demo. The [one liners tutorial](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/docs/tutorial_one_liners.md) was not, but is another great resource for learning bpftrace.
