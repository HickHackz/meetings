# General self-replication
  - John von Neumann
  - [Self-replicating machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine)
  - [Universal Constructor cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor)
  - [Self-replicating spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft)
    - Must be careful with replication rate!
    - [Hayflick limit in human cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit)
	- [Henrieta Lacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks)
  - René Descartes -> Queen Christina of Sweden, perhaps humans are automata; Quen Christina -> Descartes, "see to it that [this clock] produces offspring"
  - Crystal can replicate, but no modifications

# Malware
  - [Malware depiction](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4d51e3edc03cf8b9b4e42eca65180c7a-c)
  - Malware: software that does something bad
    - What does "something bad" mean?
    - Often self-modifying or encrypted code to evade detection
  - Virus: malware, embeds in (infects) other programs, spreads to other machines on the net when those programs are run
  - Worm: malware, spreads to other machines on the net on its own
  - Trojan horse: malware that disguises itself as legitimate software

# Examples
## Worm
    - Early worms, experiments in security
	  - Limited lifetimes and kill switches (hayflick limit, apoptosis)
      - Still got out-of-control!
    - [Morris Worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)
      - Exploited buffer overflows in multiple programs
      - Ignored infection status; spread unconditionally
      - Replication rate too fast! Caued unintentional damage
## Virus
    - [Creeper and Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper)
      - "Patch-forwarding", viral approach to deploying a benevolent patch
      - [Corewars](https://corewar.co.uk/index.htm)
      - [Computer Recreations column in Scientific American](https://corewar.co.uk/dewdney/index.htm)
## Rootkit
    - [Reflections on Trusting Trust virus/rootkit](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210)
      - Bug in compiler propagates to every program it compiles
      - Compilers compile other compilers
      - Therefore, bug can propagate with no trace in the source!
    - [Sony BMG copy protection Trojan/rootkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal)
      - "The industry will take whatever steps it needs to protect itself and protect its revenue streams... We will firewall Napster at source – we will block it at your cable company. We will block it at your phone company. We will block it at your ISP. We will firewall it at your PC... These strategies are being aggressively pursued because there is simply too much at stake."
      - Will anti-viruses cooperate?

# Botnets
  - Many IoT devices vulnerable!
  - Command-and-control
  - Botnets
  - [Distributed denial of service (DDoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)
    - Slow-Loris
