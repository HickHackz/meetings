# Ninja

- Build system for Chrome
- Idea:
  - Do complex work once in Ninja file generator
    - Ninja language no support for dynamic dependencies, conditionals, loops
      - Just rules with variable substitution
  - Should changing the Makefile/Ninja file cause everything to rebuild?
    - No, use command history to know if the output is different
- Profile first!
- Macro optimizations
  - Only store hashes of command in build log
    - from 200 MB to less than 2 MB on Mac OS Xâ€“and made it over 20 times faster to load.
- Micro optimizations
  - IsIdentifierCharacter -> lookup table -> lexer
  - Path canonicalization takes a lot of time
